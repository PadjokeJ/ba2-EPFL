Adding two decimal numbers involves a simple algorithm

>[!Algorithm]
>Place the numbers on top of each other
>Right align the least significant digits
>Add the digits together, (as well as the carry)

Substraction is done in a similar manner, except that we don't have carries, but borrows

## Unsigned Binary Addition

Very similar :
>[!Example]
>$$\begin{array}l & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\ & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ + & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\ \hline & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0\end{array}$$

For us to represent the sum of two unsigned binary numbers of length $n$, we need $n+1$ bits
>[!Warning] We don't always have enough bits in hardware, we sometimes have a wrong result, and we say that an **overflow** has occurred

## Unsigned Binary Subtraction

Same idea as for decimal numbers
>[!Example]
>$$\begin{array}l & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ - & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\ \hline & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \end{array}$$

If we subtract a bigger number from a smaller number, but the result will be positive.

>[!Warning] An **underflow** can happen when $b\gt a, a-b$

## Two's Complement Addition and Subtraction

>[!Algorithm] Addition is the same as unsigned addition

>[!Warning] Overflows can still happen, but we can detect them

>[!Example] If the two operands have the same sign, but the result has a different sign, then overflow has happened

>[!Check] Two operands of different signs will never produce an overflow
>

>[!Algorithm] Subtraction is addition of two signed numbers

## Multiplication

Multiplication for decimal numbers is just adding a bunch of times the value to itself

## Multiplication for Unsigned Binary Numbers

>[!Algorithm]
>We add the number that is multiplied if the multiplicand is one
>We shift the multiplier
>And then we perform addition
>We repeat the process until we finish multiplying

>[!Example]
>$$1011 \cdot 1101\implies 0000 + 1011 \implies 1011 + 0000\_ \implies 1011 + 1011\_\_ \implies 0110111 + 1011\_\_\_ = 10001111$$

## Multiplication for Signed Binary Numbers

We subtract a value which is the sign bit. (Add it via complement of sign + 1)

We redo the multiplication, by extending with the sign
