# Representation 

- A **bit** is the most basic unit of information
- It can have two possible states: on (1) or off (0)
- Usually grouped into bigger data structures (bytes)

In mathematics we call a bigger data structures as a **tuple**
- ordered structure of $n$ elements, each element being a **digit**

In digital systems, we have ordered tuples to represent numbers

## Non-negative integers

- **Digit-vector** (or string) representing the integer $x$ is denoted by
  $$x = (X_{n-1},\ X_{n-2},\ \dots,\ X_1,\ X_0)$$
- The **least significant** digit (or **low-order** digit): $X_0$
- The **most significant** digit (or **high-order** digit): $X_{n-1}$

## (Non) Redundant Number Systems

A number system is nonredundant if
- each digit-vector represents a different integer
A number system is redundant if
- The are numbers represented in multiple ways

## Weighted Number Systems

We have the digits associated to a weight corresponding to its position in the number:
$$x = \sum_{i = 0}^{n - 1} X_i\cdot W_i$$

When those weights $W_i$ are of the form
$$\begin{cases}W_0 = 1 \\ W_i = W_{i-1} \cdot R_{i-1}, \qqquad 1 \le i \le n - 1\end{cases}$$
Which is a **radix** number system

## Fixed and Mixed Radix Number Systems

All the elements of the radix vectors have the same value $r$ (the radix) -> a fixed-radix number

| Fixed Radix | Mixed Radix         |
| ----------- | ------------------- |
| Decimal     | Time ($HH:MM:SS$)    |
| Binary      | Imperial units      |
| Octal       | Bits -> Bytes -> kb |
| Hex         |                     |

## Conventional Number Systems

A system with
- a fixed positive radix $r$
- a canonical set of digit values
	- **A radix-$r$ conventional number system**

# Binary/Octal/Hex to/from Decimal

We can convert binary to decimal
$$10011_2 = 1 \cdot 2^4 + 0 \cdot 2^3 + 0 \cdot 2^2 + 1 \cdot 2^1 + 1 \cdot 2^0 = 19$$

For decimal to binary, you divide by the base, the remainder is the bit value

$$ 5 / 2 = 2 \text{ rem } 1 \implies 2 / 2 = 1 \text{ rem } 0 \implies 1 / 2 = 0 \text{ rem } 1 \implies 5_{10} = 101_2$$

# Signed Integers

The most significant bit defines whether the number is postive or negative

| Postive | Negative |
| ------- | -------- |
| 0       | 1        |

We can have symmetrical number system, where the positive and negative are only differentiated by the sign

### Left Arithmetic Shift

We discard the second most significant bit (to keep the sign), and shift the rest

### Right Arithmetic Shift

We shift to the right (keeping the sign in the same spot), padding with 0s

## True and Complement (TC)

A **signed integer** is represented by a positive integer $x_R$
$$x_R = x \mod C$$

For $\vert x \vert \lt C$, we have
$$x_R = \begin{cases} x & \text{if } x\ge 0 \\ C - \vert x \vert = C + x & \text{if } x \lt 0 \end{cases}$$

## Range Extension

If we want to represent a signed number on more bits than it currently has, we move the sign to the first and pad the rest with zeros/ones (if negative)

>[!Example]
>$1001$ ($-7$) -> to 8 bits
>We move the sign, and pad with ones (negative) -> $1111\ 1001$

### Left Arithmetic Shift

We discard the second most significant bit and shift the rest to the left (pad the end with zeros)

### Right Arithmetic Shift

We shift to the right, copying the sign to the new most significant bit, we lost the least significant bit

# Different Codes

## Hamming weight and distance

**Distance:** How much the numbers differ from each other, bitwise (so the number of different bits)

**Weight:** The amount of ones ($1$) in a number

## Gray's code

When you increment the number, the hamming distance is 1
